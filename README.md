Project Overview
In this project, I aimed to analyze the dining landscape, focusing on various factors like pricing, delivery options, and cuisine types. My goal was to create a comprehensive dashboard .

Data Modeling

To begin with, I utilized Power Query for data cleaning and transformation. This included :
-Removing Duplicates: Ensuring that each restaurant entry was unique and accurate.
- Handling Missing Data : Identifying and addressing gaps in the dataset to maintain data integrity.
- Transformations : Converting data types and formatting fields for better usability.
 Data Visualization

Once the data was clean and structured, I created several dynamic visualizations to convey insights effectively:

1. Slicer : I implemented a slicer to allow users to filter by price range, online delivery options, and the total number of cities represented. This feature enhances interactivity and allows for personalized data exploration. 📊
2. Gauge Chart : This visualization displays the maximum average cost for two diners, providing quick insight into dining expenses in different areas. 🎯
3. Bar Chart : I created a bar chart to showcase the sum of votes categorized by rating. This helps identify which restaurants are most favored by customers. 📈
4. Stacked Column Chart : This chart illustrates the total number of restaurants by rating color and rating, allowing users to see the distribution of restaurant ratings at a glance. 🍽️
5. Map Visualization : I utilized a map to display the total number of restaurants by city, making geographic trends easily identifiable. 🗺️
6. Tree map : This visualization shows the total number of restaurants by cuisine type, highlighting the diversity in dining options available. 🌐
7. Additional Bar Chart : Finally, I created another bar chart to represent the total number of restaurants by city, further emphasizing the dining landscape across various locations. 📉
